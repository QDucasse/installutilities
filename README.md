# Installation facilities for macOS

---

This repository is based on *brandonb927*'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/brandonb927/dotfiles) and their customisation for my usage. 



### Usage 

Clone the repository and run the main files `bootstrap.sh` for utilities and app installations or `macos.sh` for macOS customisation.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/QDucasse/install_utilities.git
$ cd install_utilities
$ sh bootstrap.sh
$ sh macos.sh
```

### Dive in

This part consists of an explanation of the contents of the main scripts for the installation and customisation.

1. **`bootstrap.sh`**

The different components run by `bootstrap.sh` are the following:

***The first two are mandatory***

- `brew.sh`: Install `homebrew`
- `oh-my-zsh.sh`: Install `zsh` and some plugins (`oh-my-zsh-plugins.sh`)

***The next ones are asked to be confirmed by the user***
